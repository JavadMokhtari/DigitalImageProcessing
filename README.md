# Digital Image Processing

Welcome to the Image Processing repository! This repository contains a collection of Python applications for various image processing tasks. Each folder in this repository represents a different image processing application. Here's an overview of the available apps:

## ImageColorSegmentation

The ImageColorSegmentation app provides functionality for segmenting images based on color. It allows you to extract specific colors or color ranges from an image, separating them from the rest of the image content. You can find more details and instructions on how to use this app in the [ImageColorSegmentation](./ImageColorSegmentation) folder.

## HoughTransform

The HoughTransform app implements the Hough transform algorithm for detecting lines and circles in images. It provides a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing geometric shapes within images. To learn more about the Hough transform and how to utilize this app, refer to the [HoughTransform](./HoughTransform) folder.

## ImageMosaic

The ImageMosaic app allows you to create image mosaics, also known as photomosaics, by reconstructing a larger image using smaller image tiles. This app takes a main image and a dataset of smaller images and arranges them to form a mosaic representation. For instructions on how to use this app and create stunning image mosaics, check out the [ImageMosaic](./ImageMosaics) folder.

Feel free to explore each app's folder for more information, usage instructions, and sample code.

## Requirements

To run these image processing apps, you need to have Python installed, along with the necessary dependencies specified in each app's respective folder.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance and expand the capabilities of these image processing apps. If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request.


We hope you find these image processing apps useful and enjoy exploring the world of image processing!

Happy coding!
